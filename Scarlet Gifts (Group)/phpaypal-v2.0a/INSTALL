BACKGROUND:
I found some asp code on the PayPal Developers Network - good stuff written by superfreaker.com.
I wanted to use it but I don't speak ASP so I converted it to PHP.
It didn't do paging the way I am used to so I gutted the paging and rewrote it. I hope you like.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Apache
2. PHP
3. MYSQL
4. A PayPal Account

INSTALLATION:
1. Untar the source in a directory that is under a web root
  tar zxvf phpaypa-ver.tar.gz
  This will create a directory like phpaypal-v1.0
2 Link the version:
ln -s phpaypal-v1.0 phpaypal
  This will make it easier to get to.

3. Create a Database.
shell> mysqladmin create phpaypal

4. Import the tables from the mysql dump - found in the database/ directory.
shell> mysql < database/phpaypal.mysql 

5. Create or copy your product images into the images directory.
  There are columns in the database for large and small images.  This is
  to accomodate thumbnail and detail images.

6. Use phpMyAdmin to enter data into the database.
 (I know - lame - I should have an admin routine to allow for this - 
  maybe during my vacatation next week)
  The index.php and detail.php programs look for images in the ./images
  directory - so simply provide the names of the images in the database - 
  no full path required.

7. Modify the params in the includes/database.php file:

$dbhost="localhost"; name of the host that has the database on it.
$dbuser="<insert your mysql username here>";
$dbpasswd="<insert your mysql password here>";
$dbname="phpaypal"; #typically phpaypal

8. Point your browser to the index.php file to test.
