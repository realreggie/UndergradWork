DESCRIPTION:
phpaypal is a set of scripts that read from a database and display products with
links to the PayPal service.  

BACKGROUND:
I found some asp code on the PayPal Developers Network - good stuff written by superfreaker.com.
I wanted to use it but I don't speak ASP so I converted it to PHP.
It didn't do paging the way I am used to so I gutted the paging and rewrote it. I hope you like.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Apache
2. PHP
3. MYSQL
4. A PayPal Account

INSTALLATION:
Read the INSTALL file in this directory.

TODO:

Clean the code!
Add backend to receive updates from paypal and update a transaction table.
